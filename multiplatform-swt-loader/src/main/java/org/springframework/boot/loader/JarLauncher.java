/**
 * This is copied from original {@link JarLauncher} spring-boot-loader project.
 * The only change here is to call
 * {@code MultiPlatformSwtHelper.isCorrectPlatformSwtJarOrTrue()}.
 * 
 * BEWARE: Keep the class name and package name the same! Also update this class
 * once you update spring-boot-loader project!
 * 
 * How this works? The spring-boot-maven-plugin will copy spring-boot-loader
 * classes first and user classes, jars and resources after that. We abuse that
 * fact and create class with the same fully qualified name with modified
 * behavior here.
 * 
 * Note: For that reason we can't inherit or reuse the original class. We would
 * need two different versions of the same class on the classpath. A cleaner way
 * would be to tell spring-boot-maven-plugin to use different main class (the
 * real 'Main-Class' class as written in MANIFEST.MF). Even better would be to
 * be able to register some sort of listener adding our functionality to
 * spring-boot-loader. However neither of the two options are (currently)
 * supported.
